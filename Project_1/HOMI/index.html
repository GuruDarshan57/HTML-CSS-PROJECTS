                <h4>Father of the Indian Nuclear Program</h1>
                    <p>Homi Jehangir Bhabha, FNI,[3] FASc,[1] FRS,[4] Hon.FRSE (30 October 1909 – 24 January 1966) was
                        an
                        Indian nuclear physicist who is widely credited as the "father of the Indian nuclear programme".
                        He
                        was the founding director and professor of physics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
                        (TIFR), as well as the founding director of the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET)
                        which
                        was renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honour. TIFR and AEET served as the
                        cornerstone
                        of the Indian nuclear energy and weapons programme. He was the first chairman of the Indian
                        Atomic
                        Energy Commission and secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy. By supporting space science
                        projects which initially derived their funding from the AEC, he played an important role in the
                        birth of the Indian space programme.

                        He was awarded the Adams Prize (1942) and Padma Bhushan (1954), and nominated for the Nobel
                        Prize
                        for Physics in 1951 and 1953–1956.

                        He died in the crash of Air India Flight 101 in 1966, at the age of 56.</p>
